## First Data Map
<br>
The first visualization is a recreation of a historical map. In 1854, John Snow personally surveyed the area to get the data and create a map of Soho London to show the location of deaths from Cholera and then locations of water pumps. He found that the deaths were more dense near the pumps suggesting the water was a possible cause, closing the pump for a short period had significant effects in reducing the deaths by cholera in that area showing success in action made from a data map!

## Galton and Regression
<br>
In 1886 Galton took data on the hights of parents and children and compared them in a scatter plot. He did this by calculating a mid-parent height that was their weighted average and then showed that the regression line (as we call it now) is less steep than the line of equality (when parent and child is the same). He was showing that children are on average, closer in height to population height than their parents (so less extreme heights). Today we can model this in 3d to avoid combining the parents data. You could possible see if Mother of Father's heights had a larger impact, or whether gender is more important from a visualization like this. Note that with the right tools you could find the same conclusion as Galton from this visual.

## Population Density Choropleth
<br>
This last visualization clearly depicts the population data from France split by Department. This is a modern spin off of Charles Dupin's choropleth from 1826. He plotted literacy rates by department and was the first to design a choropleth like the ones we use today! The choropleth is useful in depicting relative frequencies of data across physical regions.
